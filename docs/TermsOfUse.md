# Trial Period
- The app includes a 7-day trial period designed to allow you to evaluate the full functionality of the app and to ensure compatibility with your hardware and software environment.
- After the 7-day trial expires, the app will be disabled.
- User configuration options will remain unchanged at the end of the trial, awaiting the unlock of the app. 
- Please use the trial period to confirm that the app meets your needs, as there is no refund option.
# License Price and Purchase Process
- The purchase price, currency, and applicable tax levels (Sales Tax or VAT) depend on your purchase location. These are automatically suggested by our third-party payment provider (Lemon Squeezy LLC) based on your IP address but can be customized during the checkout process. Any adjustments made during checkout (due to currency, FX rates, or tax differences) are your responsibility, so please ensure you set your location according to applicable regulations.
- Local sales tax is included in purchase price seen at checkout and is not added on.
- You may add business details and a VAT number (required for VAT returns) during or after checkout.
- Lemon Squeezy LLC acts as the reseller for Noah Greene (the maker of this app). Lemon Squeezy provides the online purchasing experience, handles invoicing, manages payment methods, licenses, activations, and refunds (subject to our refund policy). For any issues regarding these areas, you may consult Lemon Squeezy’s buyer support.
# License Conditions
- Licenses are valid for the current major version (at the time of purchase) of the app. Major version upgrades may require a new license purchase, an upgrade license, or, in some cases, may allow continued use of the previous version.
- A license covers all upgrades to the major version during which it was purchased, including any new major app version if released in this time-frame.
- A license also covers all past versions of the app (if needed for compatibility).
- The license does not expire for the current major version (i.e., it is not a subscription). When or if a new major version is released, you are not forced to cease using the previous version.
-  For volume licensing (20+ computers), please contact the developer at hello@noahg.dev.
# Refund Policy and Withdrawal After Purchase
- The developer offers a 7-day trial period for you to evaluate the app and decide whether it meets your needs.
- Because of this trial period, all purchases are final, and refunds are generally not available. By downloading the app and activating your license, you waive the right to withdraw after purchase.
- The EU right of withdrawal does not apply, as the app is available for immediate use.
- In cases of license related technical issues (e.g., not receiving a license number, activation failures, or duplicate billing), you are entitled to a refund if the problem cannot be resolved.
# Compatibility Issues
- Due to the vast number of hardware and software configurations, the developer cannot guarantee that the app will work perfectly on every system. We strongly recommend using the trial period to verify compatibility with your specific setup.
- The app is highly dependent on macOS and utilizes undocumented OS features. Consequently, the developer cannot guarantee that the app or any specific functionality will work properly on every new version of macOS. While Apple continually enhances macOS, these changes can occasionally break functionality.
- Compatibility issues generally do not qualify for refunds; however, refunds may be considered on a case-by-case basis if warranted.
# Support
- The developer is committed to supporting the user community by responding to GitHub Issues and answering questions via email. However, please note that resources are limited and support is provided on a voluntary basis—owning a license does not guarantee personalized support.
- While bug fixes and issue resolutions are a priority, they are not guaranteed.
- The app is provided “as-is.” The license does not include dedicated support time, and no service-level agreement (SLA) or guarantee exists regarding bug fixes.
- If you have questions or encounter issues, you may find quicker assistance by searching through Issues on GitHub.
# Limitation of Liability
- To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the developer shall not be held liable for any damages whatsoever arising out of or in connection with the use or inability to use this app. This includes, without limitation, any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages; loss of data, profit, revenue, or business; or device malfunction or damage, even if the developer has been advised of the possibility of such damages. Use the app entirely at your own risk.
